Multiples of Three and Five. 

Based on project Euler tasks. 

The aim is to create a class that returns all multiples of three and five between 0 and 1001. 

This must be fully tested in Rspec. 

The idea was to practise calling created methods within each other, alongside standard ruby built-in methods. 

The code can definitely be refactored, but I have left it as a practise example. 

`````
run from the directory using:
./lib/three_and_five.rb
`````
